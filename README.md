# LOGO++
A reimagination of LOGO with object oriented concepts.<br>
Aim of this project is to create a language that is simple and fun enough to teach 4th & 5th graders object oriented programming concepts while at the same time being flexible enough to be extended for more demanding work in the future.


This is a work in progress.<br>
At presently, it is in its inception.<br>
Although the language guidelines have been formulated, they are not set in stone and may change significantly by the time version 1.0 is released.


Do note that LOGO++ is not intended to be a general purpose programming language.<br>
With that in mind, LOGO++ will have feature additions incrementally.<br>

However, as it stands, version 1.0 will be pretty barebones and as such will allow only a subset of features of Object Oriented Progamming. For instance, it will lack the concept of functions although constructors will be an integral part of the language.<br>
This is an intentional design choice since the primary objective of LOGO++ is to teach basic concepts of OOP to 4th and 5th graders.<br>

To transcend use of LOGO++ for more serious work, subsequent versions will extend the original specification to include more high level features.
