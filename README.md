# LOGO++
A reimagination of LOGO with object oriented concepts.<br>
Aim of this project is to create a language that is simple and fun enough to teach 4 & 5th graders object oriented programming concepts while at the same time being flexible enough to be extended for more demanding work in the future.


This is a work in progress.<br>
At presently, it is in its inception.<br>
Although the language guidelines have been formulated, they are not set in stone and may change significantly by the time version 1.0 is released.


Have any inputs that would make LOGO++ better?<br>
